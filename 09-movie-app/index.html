          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            Kōmei devises a plan where Zoro and Sanji take part in an eating
            contest, and the two eat a strange "good-for-nothing-only" mushroom
            that turns them into good-for-nothing men. The two are then locked
            in a jail cell. When the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates chase after
            their imprisoned crew, they land on the island of Nebulandia, which
            features a mysterious fog made from sea water, and it has the same
            effects as seastone. The Straw Hat Pirates' arrival on Nebulandia is
            also a part of Kōmei's plan.
